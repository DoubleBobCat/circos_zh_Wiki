### lesson
[CircosAPI](https://kylase.github.io/CircosAPI) is a Perl module that is
written to provide users with a Perl interface to create Circos graphics.

The module generates the configuration from within Perl code, giving you the
ability to incorporate Circos into your pipeline.

A [tutorial is available](https://kylase.github.com/CircosAPI/tutorials) for
users to understand how it works and it is analogous to the [Circos Quick
Guide tutorial](/documentation/tutorials/quick_guide).
