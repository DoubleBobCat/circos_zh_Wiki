Use the [latest version of Circos](/software/download/circos/) and read
[Circos best
practices](/documentation/tutorials/reference/best_practices/)—these list
recent important changes and identify sources of common problems.

If you are having trouble, post your issue to the [Circos Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/group/circos-data-visualization) and [include
all files and detailed error logs](/support/support/). Please do not email me
directly unless it is urgent—you are much more likely to receive a timely
reply from the group.

Don't know what question to ask? Read [Points of View: Visualizing Biological
Data](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v9/n12/full/nmeth.2258.html) by
Bang Wong, myself and invited authors from the [Points of View
series](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/pointsofview).

# 12 — Circos Reference

## 2\. API

[CircosAPI](https://kylase.github.io/CircosAPI) is a Perl module that is
written to provide users with a Perl interface to create Circos graphics.

The module generates the configuration from within Perl code, giving you the
ability to incorporate Circos into your pipeline.

A [tutorial is available](https://kylase.github.com/CircosAPI/tutorials) for
users to understand how it works and it is analogous to the [Circos Quick
Guide tutorial](/documentation/tutorials/quick_guide).
