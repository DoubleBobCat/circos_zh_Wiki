### lesson
If Circos is not behaving as you expect, the first thing to do is to run it
with a `-debug` flag. For example,

```    
    > bin/circos -debug 
```
This will create high-level summary debug reporting about I/O operations and
show you some timings. To generate in-depth debugging of specific components,
see the section about `-debug_group`.

#### configuration dump
Once the configuration file is parsed, you can ask for a full dump of the
entire configuration tree.

```    
    > bin/circos -cdump 
```
This is very useful in cases when you are not sure how your configuration
files are being parsed. For example, you are receiving errors about parsing a
specific parameter, use `-cdump` to make sure that (a) the parameter is indeed
defined and (b) it is defined only once.

```    
    > bin/circos -cdump | grep default_color
    default_color => 'black',
```
You can create a dump of only one part of the configuration tree by providing
an argument

```    
    # show only the <ideogram> block
    > bin/circos -cdump ideogram
```
### Group Debugging
To obtain debug information about specific components, use `-debug_group` with
one or more of these strings separated by a comma (e.g. `-debug_group
cache,chrfilter,rule`).

  * angle 
  * anglepos 
  * bezier 
  * brush 
  * cache 
  * chrfilter 
  * color 
  * conf 
  * counter 
  * heatmap 
  * ideogram 
  * image 
  * io 
  * karyotype 
  * layer 
  * link 
  * png 
  * rule 
  * scale 
  * spacing 
  * summary (default) 
  * svg 
  * test 
  * text 
  * textplace 
  * tick 
  * tile 
  * timer 
  * unit 
  * url 
  * zoom 

By default, the `summary` group is shown. If you want to add other groups

```    
    > circos -debug_group +timer,+io
```
Or if you want just a specific group

```    
    > circos -debug_group timer
```
To show debug for all groups

```    
    > circos -debug_group _all
```
On UNIX, you can use `grep` to parse out the debug reports for specific
groups. For example,

```    
    # store all debug output in circos.debug.txt and display only karyotype 
    > circos ... -group_debug _all | tee circos.debug.txt | egrep "debuggroup karyotype"
    # extract other debug reports
    > egrep "debuggroup rule" circos.debug.txt
    > egrep "debuggroup (rule|scale)" circos.debug.txt
```
#### Benchmarking
If you are concerned about performance, use the `timer` debug group to turn on
timing information. The time taken to execute Circos' components is reported
in the following format. Not every part of the code is timed at the moment â€”
this section is likely to expand in the future to include other components. If
the image takes more than 30 seconds to run, or if you use `-debug_group
timer`, you will see a list of component timings. For instance, if you run the
example

```    
    > cd example
    > ../bin/circos -debug_group +timer

```
Some of the component timing groups are nested. For example, any time spent on
`ideograms_ticks_draw` is included in `ideograms_draw`.

Extensive debug reporting will make Circos run more slowly.
