title: Combining Scales

### lesson
In this final example, I combine all the scale adjustments discussed in this
tutorial section into one image. I've added a histogram plot, in addition to
the heat map, that shows the scale across the ideograms. The histogram y-axis
is graduated every 0.5 from 0x to 10x. The y-axis labels were added in post-
processing (Circos does not know how to do this - yet).

Chromosomes 1, 2 and 3 are displayed, with chromosome 2 split into three
ideograms. Two ranges on chromosome 2 are defined 0-100 and 150-), as well as
an axis break 40-60Mb. Chromosomes 1 and 3 have a baseline scale of 1x and
chromosome 2 has a baseline scale of 2x (first two ideograms) and 0.5x (third
ideogram).

Notice how the three ideograms on chromosome two are defined. First, Circos is
told to draw two regions 0-100 (ideogram id "a") and 150-) (ideogram id "b").
Scale factors of 2x and 0.5x are then assigned to these ideograms. Finally, an
axis break is introduced at 40-60Mb, which breaks the "a" ideogram into two.
However, the global scale is still 2x across the two new pieces, which are
still internally labeled as "a", and therefore the ideogram label is 2a for
both pieces.

At the moment, you cannot define a different global scale for ideograms that
contain an axis break. If you needed the same regions drawn, each with a
different global scale, you would define them as follows, for example

```    
    chromosomes: hs2[a]:0-40;hs2[b]:60-100;hs2[c]:150-)
    chromosomes_scale: a:2;b:3;c:0.5
```
There are several local scale adjustments in this example. On chromosome 1,
there are two zoom regions that are smoothed and their smoothing regions
overlap. Recall the rule that for a given region the scale factor is taken to
be the largest absolute zoom level for any zoom region that overlaps with it.
As the smoothing of the 10x and 0.2x regions run into each other, the is a
sudden scale shift (marked by red arrot in the vicinity of chr1:140Mb).
Currently, scale smoothing is not iterative - there is no additional smoothing
applied between adjacent smoothing regions.

On chromosome 2 there is a 5x zoom region at the start of the first ideogram.
Its smoothing region runs off the edge of the ideogram.

On chromosome 3 there are two nested zoom regions. The outer region is 0.5x
25-150Mb and the inner region is 10x 72-73Mb. Both are smoothed, but their
smoothing does not overlap.

Currently, a region is smoothed by gradually adjusting its scale from that
defined in the configuration file to the ideogram's base scale. In the last
case, where one region (10x) was nested inside another (0.5x), the inner
region is still smoothed between 10x and 1x, the latter being the ideograms'
base scale. Keep this in mind when nesting regions.

Finally, a word about tick marks and scale adjustment. Experiment with the
tick mark parameters `label_separation`, `tick_separation` and
`min_label_distance_to_edge`. If you are going to be significantly expand the
scale in some regions, define tick marks with sufficiently small spacing to
cover the expanded region in ticks. Set the tick_separation to avoid tick mark
crowding in regions with a lower scale.

If you are going to change scale, make sure that this fact is made clear in
your figure. You can mark this fact by using highlights or a heatmap. Circos
will produce a report of zoom regions as it's drawing the image, and you can
use this output to create data files to annotate the figure (you need to run
Circos twice â€” once to generate the file and again to plot it).

    zoomregion ideogram 2 chr hs2  64000001  65000001 scale  1.42 absolutescale  1.42
    zoomregion ideogram 2 chr hs2  65000001  66000001 scale  1.33 absolutescale  1.33
    zoomregion ideogram 2 chr hs2  66000001  67000001 scale  1.25 absolutescale  1.25
    ...
```
The absolute scale is `max(scale,1/scale)`.
