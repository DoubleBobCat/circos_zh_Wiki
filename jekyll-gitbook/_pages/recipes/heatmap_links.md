title: Heat Map Links
---

### lesson
You can color links by an associated value to create a heatmap effect.

Heatmaps were discussed in [2d Tracksâ€”Heatmap
tutorial](//documentation/tutorials/2d_tracks/heatmaps).

#### assigning value to links
At this time there is no way to associate a value with a link in the same way.
However, you can subvert one of the link parameters to do so. For example, use
a `value` parameter.

```    
    hs12 117427133 132349534 hs2 94056542 114056542 value=2
    hs22 33232924 49691432 hs4 88399610 108399610 value=5
```
#### coloring links by value
Now that each link has a value, it's time to use it to set its color. Rules
are used for this.

To reference the link's value, use `var(value)`.

The first rule maps the "url" value onto a list of colors. In this example,
the "url" value is in the range [0,4]. To map the value to a color, you will
need to use an eval() block and write a Perl one-liner to sample a list. If
the list contains entries that do not have a space (e.g. single word colors),
you can use the qw() operator which turns words into a list.

```    
    qw(red orange green blue purple)
```
Perl's syntax to sample an element of a list is

```    
    ( ...list here...)[i]
```
Combining these

```    
    (qw(red orange green blue purple))[i]
```
In this case the value of `i` is the `value` parameter, reference by
`var(value)`.

```    
    <rules>
    
    <rule>
    # always trigger this rule
    condition  = 1
    # use the link's value to sample from a list of colors
    color      = eval((qw(red orange green blue purple))[ var(value) ])
    # continue parsing other rules
    flow       = continue
    </rule>
    
    <rule>
    # always trigger this rule
    condition  = 1
    # add _a3 to the color of the ribbon, giving it 50% transparency (3/6)
    color      = eval(sprintf("%s_a3",var(color)))
    </rule>
    
    </rules>
