recent important changes and identify sources of common problems.

If you are having trouble, post your issue to the [Circos Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/group/circos-data-visualization) and [include
all files and detailed error logs](/support/support/). Please do not email me
directly unless it is urgent—you are much more likely to receive a timely
reply from the group.
